"""
In the Set Mismatch problem, you will be given an array of positive integers with some elements\
    missing or duplicated. You need to identify and return the missing and duplicated numbers \
        to solve this problem.

Hereâ€™s an example of the input and output values of this problem:

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6] | Output: [5, 4]
In this example, the missing number is 5 since it is the only positive integer from 1 to 6 that\
    is not present in the array, and the duplicate number is 4 since it appears twice.
